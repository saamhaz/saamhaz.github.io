In game theory and economics, *Homo Economicus*, or “economic man,” is the rational agent that selects strategies to maximize profit and utility based on complete information. The term refers to human decision-makers and remains accurate today since the required mindset and ability to act are largely the purview of humans. But that won’t stay true forever.

We suggest that *robo economicus* – AI agents that can participate in markets across both physical and digital worlds – represent an upleveling of the capabilities of AI in the future. Just as engines replaced physical labor, these agents will eventually offload much of the cognitive effort required to navigate markets and systems.

The key shift is **autonomy**: these agents won’t simply follow instructions. They’ll manage resources, negotiate, and make autonomous decisions. 

## Convergence

When emergent technologies come into the world, they arrive in a primitive state. They're difficult to neatly categorize and only solve a narrow set of problems. Several of these technologies often exist simultaneously, but they remain siloed and limited to specific applications.

A pivotal moment occurs when someone – an engineer, founder, or outsider – grasps the latent potential in combining seemingly unrelated technologies. These tech elements then collide to shatter the old order and give rise to a new landscape of applications. 

Over the last two decades, we saw three siloed technologies converge in this way: **cloud computing, mobile, and GPS/geolocation**. 

- *Cloud computing* provided the scalability to process real-time requests and implement dynamic pricing.
- *Smartphones* had intuitive interfaces for messages and push notifications.
- *GPS* was introduced to smartphones, allowing for dedicated civilian use outside of military applications.

These three domains eventually converged, acting as the starting pistol for the tech era known as the “on-demand economy.” Summoning a car from a phone or delivering dinner from any restaurant, which previously demanded massive infrastructure and real-world coordination, suddenly became possible with just code and APIs.

Each tech epoch is born from and defined by a combinatorial platform shift. What then are the frontiers of computing today, and how do they intersect? 

## Robo Economicus

The three emerging frontiers in computing today are **artificial intelligence, crypto, and the platforms enabling applications that read-write to the physical world**. An interesting point towards which these three frontiers converge is in giving AI agents the ability to perform in domains that today are largely the purview of humans. In a sense, the convergence of AI, crypto, and physical world platforms allows agents to extend the breadth of their capabilities into new domains.

Today, there are two domains that are largely “human-only:” **markets** and **the physical world**. Markets, as they are currently constructed, require legal personhood, and interacting with the physical world requires embodiment. In their current form, AI agents have neither of these qualities. We explore here how combining AI with crypto and physical world platforms, specifically robotics, allows future agents to operate in areas that were previously off-limits. 

## Market Coordination

Markets consist of the mechanisms by which we communicate information, organize resources, and engage in collective decision-making. They are, in a sense, one of the most important tools in the toolkit for social coordination. Being able to perform tasks that require interacting with other agents, people, and services will require participating in markets.

Robots will not operate in isolation. To establish a baseline, there are several different types of **multirobot coordination systems**:

1. **Centralized coordination** – A single central controller plans and assigns tasks to all robots. As systems become more complex, central coordination quickly becomes computationally infeasible.
2. **Behavior-based coordination** – Coordination emerges through predefined robot behaviors, triggered by environmental stimuli. Optimal for real-time, reactive tasks in dynamic environments where simplicity and immediacy are critical, like collision avoidance.
3. **Market-based or auction-based coordination** – Robots act as economic agents in a virtual market, "bidding" for tasks or resources based on their efficiency in performing them. Tasks are allocated based on bids.

### Crypto as the Financial Layer for Robots

But what will robots in market-based coordination systems transact with? 

They cannot participate in financial markets, nor can they bid on auctions. The way we have constructed markets today requires **personhood**: AI agents cannot get a bank account, nor can they make payments without human oversight or dependency. Even if Visa or traditional payments processors were to offer a workaround that involved human intervention, it would not be enough. 

Multirobot coordination systems will need to use **cryptocurrencies**.

For most people in the Western world, crypto’s properties are seen as *nice-to-haves*. Properties like **immutability, decentralization, censorship resistance, near-perfect uptime, and permissionlessness** are intellectually interesting. Assets with these features are “worth having exposure to” but are not critical to everyday transactions. 

But the dynamic changes when we put robots that need to transact and coordinate autonomously into the world. Here, the payment method isn't decided by end-users; **it’s decided by developers**.

## Physical World Actions

Beyond social coordination, the physical world is where many of the most important processes for a functioning society take place: the manipulation of matter, the harnessing of natural resources, and foundational infrastructure for survival and prosperity.

The role of AI in robotics over the last decade has moved towards bringing more of the robotics pipeline into **neural networks**. The goal is **end-to-end robot learning**: taking sensor input and directly outputting robotic action.

Embodied AI extends far beyond humanoid robots or quadruped robot dogs. It includes all physically actuated devices: from drones and autonomous vehicles to mechanical machines, operating individually or in coordinated groups.

## Embodiment and Intelligence

Embodied AI agents could be used for many physical world use cases that require **planning ahead and long-horizon reasoning**. These range from household tasks like food preparation or organizing objects, to **inspecting and maintaining complex physical infrastructure, operating in unstructured environments like mining sites, and autonomously operating construction sites**.

Embodiment is not only essential for interacting with the physical world but also for **perceiving and reasoning** about it. The **embodiment hypothesis** argues that intelligence emerges from the bottom up, contrary to the view that reasoning about physics and the physical world emerges from language.

## Intersections

Across **artificial intelligence, crypto, and physical world platforms**, there are areas where these different frontiers are mutually enabling, unlocking applications or domains via their intersections. 

### AI x Crypto

- **Agentic Networks** – AI agents participating in financial markets and decentralized marketplaces.
- **DeAI** – Decentralized inference for AI workloads.
- **Data Collection and Generation** – Crypto incentives streamlining data collection and labeling.

### Crypto x Physical

**DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks)** solve two hard problems in infrastructure:

1. **Dynamic supply in response to changing demand.**
2. **Bootstrapping infrastructure without massive upfront investment.**

### Physical x AI 

AI’s expansion into the physical world includes:

- **Embodied AI** – AI agents interacting with real-world environments.
- **World Models** – Simulations that enable better robotic training.
- **Autonomous Machines** – Cars, drones, heavy machinery.

## Final Thoughts

Every major leap in technology has been marked by the **collapse of boundaries**: from information and communication to the physical and digital. Today, we are on the brink of another collapse, as **AI, crypto, and physical-world platforms converge**.

From **decentralized agentic economies** to **embodied AI reshaping physical infrastructure**, we’re seeing the outlines of **robo economicus**: agents that can autonomously engage with the digital, economic, and physical worlds. Agents that can **perceive, decide, and act** without human mediation.

The starting pistol has been fired. What happens next will rewrite the economic and technological order.
